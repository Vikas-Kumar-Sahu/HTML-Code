<!--
    In this example, comments are used to provide explanations within the HTML code. Comments are not rendered in the browser, so they are useful for adding notes to the code for yourself or other developers without affecting the displayed content. Comments can be single-line or multi-line. Keep in mind that comments should not be used as a way to hide or disable code in production; they are purely for documentation and developer understanding.
